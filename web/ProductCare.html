<span class="sizeB">How to Take Good Care of a Leather Bag</span><span class="sizeC">
To maintain leather bag in good condition, the following 
points are highly recommended.
--Protect your leather bag from humidity and avoid exposure 
to sunlight or to any direct heat source as its shape will 
be easily deformed or the color may fade.
--Avoid overloading the bag.
--To avoid color migration, please do not put your leather bag 
into prolonged contact with other leathers.
--Avoid using plastic bag to store shinny leather bag.
--Avoid contacting with water and any product containing 
alcohol (perfume, solventsâ€¦), grease or abrasive products 
in general.
</span>
<span class="sizeB">Daily Care</span><span class="sizeC">
Simply daily care can lift up the durability of leather bag. 
--If a leather bag gets wet, use a dry cloth to absorb the 
moisture. Then air the bag in shaded area. Do not use dryer 
or air-conditioner, or expose under sunlight for drying. 
Otherwise, cracks on the bag may be easily caused.
--Use leather stain remover on regular basis. Leather stain 
remover should be placed on a cloth rather than on the 
leather surface directly. Do not wash the bag in water or 
with any unknown chemical solvents.
--Drying agents (e.g. Silica get) can be placed into 
leather bag when kept for a relative long period.
--In order to preserve your leather bag, please store them 
in the dust bag that was offered to you.
</span>
<span class="sizeB">How to Clean a Leather Bag</span><span class="sizeC">
Different kinds of leather require different cleaning 
methods to maintain their best condition.
--Calf & Sheep skin
Put leather stain remover on dry cloth to rub away dirt. 
Then, polish the whole bag to make it shine.
--Patent Leather & Metallic Leather
Patent leather should be cleaned with a soft dampened 
cloth, and then dried with a clean cloth.
--Woven & Nylon Material
Apply dilute soap or stain remover with water and then 
slightly rub away dirt marks with soft brush. Do not 
soak and clean the bag in the water.
</span>
<span class="sizeB">How to Keep a Mal-function Zipper in Good Condition</span><span class="sizeC">
--Put a small amount of white wax along the zipper to 
smoothen it.
--If gold, Silver or Bronze Metal Fitting is tarnished, please apply 
metal shine lotion on a cloth and rub the tarnished area gently 
until the metal becomes shinny.
